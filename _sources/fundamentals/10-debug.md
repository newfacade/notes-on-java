# Debugging

Debugging steps in IntelliJ:

1. Set break point
2. Run -> Debug, the program will execute to the break point line.
3. Step over line by line.

We can also rerun the program, step into and step out.

Pay attention to the variable window, which automatically detect variables that are currently in their scope and shows their value.
